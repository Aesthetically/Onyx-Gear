Onyx-Gear
=========

Onyx Gear is inspired to be an application that collects and displays multiple sets of data with the day of the year as a common parameter. Currently the program is projected to display the numerical data of a person's life such as net income, net expenditure, money supply and gasoline supply (measured at the pump). With a convenient display of graphs  it is possible to set up a person's life as a company. All of the resources displayed can be managed to lead a more efficient lifestyle.
