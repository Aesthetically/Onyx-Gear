Onyx-Gear
=========

Onyx Gear is inspired to be an application that collects and displays multiple sets of data with respect to time. Currently the program is projected to display the numerical data of a person's life such as net income, net expenditure, money supply and gasoline supply (measured at the pump). With a convenient display of graphs  it is possible to display a person's resources as an analogue to an industry. All resources displayed can be managed to lead a more efficient, high quality life style.
